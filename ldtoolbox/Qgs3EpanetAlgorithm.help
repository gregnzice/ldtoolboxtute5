The Qgs3Epanet algorithm takes vector and tabular input data, creates a text input file, runs the US EPA EPANET model to generate an output file and loads key features from the output file into vector layers that are automatically added to the current QGIS project.  It is substantially based on the QGIS2 'epanet' plugin developed by Oslandia (https://oslandia.com/en/home-en/).

The plugin is designed to automatically populate the parameter options if layers in the current QGIS project have names that match the generic name for the type of parameter.  For example, if there is a vector layer with the name 'options', this layer will automatically be chosen for the 'Options Table' parameter.  This also applies to vector layers containing geometry, for example if a layer in the current project is named 'junctions', it will automatically be selected for the 'Junctions Layer' parameter.  The default options can be overwritten by selecting a different layer using the pull down menu.

The 'TITLE' parameter is used to identify those features in the subset of the vector layers that pertain to the current model run.  In order for these features to be correctly identified, the 'TITLE' parameter needs to appear in the 'simulation_title' field of one of the features in the vector layer in question.  For example, in order to correctly load in the analysis options for a particular model run (e.g. 'EPANET Simulation'), there needs to be a feature in the 'Options Table' attribute table that contains the text 'EPANET Simulation' in the 'simulation_title' field.

Depending on the complexity of the system being modelled, some or all of the parameters will need to be supplied.  For further information please refer to the EPANET manual located at https://nepis.epa.gov/Adobe/PDF/P1007WWU.pdf.

Note that model output layers will automatically be loaded into the selected 'Group' in the current project's 'Layers' panel.  It is recommended that you create a group named 'EPANET Outputs' and have this group selected when you run the model simulation.
